# Project Task List ‚Äì Multi-Tenant Indian School Management System

+> **Design Guideline:** All UI/UX should be modern, clean, minimal, and visually soothing. Use soft blues/greens/pastels, lots of white space, rounded elements, subtle shadows, smooth transitions, and elegant, readable typography.

## üìã **Data Creation Workflow (Sequential Order)**
1. **Subjects** ‚Üí Create first (required for teachers)
2. **Teachers** ‚Üí Create second (assign subjects, required for class teachers)
3. **Standards & Divisions** ‚Üí Create third (assign class teachers, set capacity)
4. **Students** ‚Üí Create fourth (assign to standard/division)
5. **Timetable** ‚Üí Create last (requires all above components)

## üîê **Role-Based Permissions**
- **Super Admin**: Create/Edit/Delete/Disable tenants, Assign school admins only
- **School Admin**: Full CRUD for own school data only (subjects, teachers, students, etc.)
